Three Observable Trends:

1. The majority of unique users making a purchase are male (84.03%). Given this piece of data, it makes sense that efforts should focus on advertising to the Male demographic.

2. However, even though the majority of users are Male, Females actually purchase more per unique person ($4.47 vs $4.07). 

3. Also, the larger majority of purchases are from those whose age is below 30.

Conclusion: Given the metrics we calculated, the business model is best geared towards monetizing a large amount of small purchases. No single Item commands the majority of purchases, so efforts should be spent on the demographics that spend the largest amount of money overall. Even though the Female demographics spend more money per user, the difference is not large enough to trump the amount of overall money spent by Males. It can be said that the best demographic to target for advertising would be Males under the age of 30, especially the ages between 20 and 24 (which amount to just under half of all total dollars spent).
